# Roadmap

The guiding rule: **a finished small thing beats an unfinished big thing.** Each
release below is independently useful and independently publishable. Nothing
ships without the validation section of `docs/validation.md` being updated
first.

---

## v0.1 — Ocean model and ray tracing ✅

- Three sound speed equations (Medwin / Mackenzie / Chen-Millero-UNESCO) plus
  Leroy-Parthiot depth→pressure and the Munk canonical profile
- Fixed-capacity piecewise-linear sound speed profile, zero allocation
- Analytic constant-gradient ray tracer: exact circular arcs, exact turning
  points, exact range **and** travel-time budgets
- SOFAR / duct analysis: axis, trapping cone, conjugate depths, surface duct
- Ensonification grid and shadow zone extraction
- 791 closed-form checks, ASan/UBSan clean, float and double builds
- **Bellhop cross-validation** (`tools/bellhop_compare/`): turning depths agree
  to 0.14 mm over 101 km at Bellhop's finest step, with the residual shown to be
  the comparison's own sampling error rather than a difference between the codes

## v0.2 — Ping analysis ✅ *(current)*

The original specification jumped straight to echo synthesis, but **an echo
synthesiser with no input is not a module.** Detecting and characterising the
incoming ping is the harder half, so it shipped first.

- Radix-2 FFT, zero allocation, verified against a direct DFT to 2.3e-16
- CW / LFM / HFM synthesis with closed-form phase, and true time-scaling Doppler
- FFT overlap-save matched filtering, verified against direct correlation
- `PingAnalyzer`: matched filter bank + CA-CFAR + Pulse Descriptor Words
- ToA estimation at **0.93-1.02x the envelope Cramer-Rao bound** across 20 dB
- 100/100 waveform classification at -4.4 dB input SNR
- 29x real time on one core; 65 ms detection latency, set by the block length

## v0.3 — Real data and eigenrays

- [x] **Bellhop cross-validation.** Done in v0.1.1. Both codes read the same
      `.env`; Bellhop converges toward the analytic arc solution as its step
      shrinks. See `docs/validation.md §2`.
- [ ] **Chen-Millero against the published UNESCO check table**, as a unit test
      with the official values rather than mutual agreement between equations.
- [ ] **Real T/S profiles.** World Ocean Atlas (WOA23) and Argo float ingest;
      ship two or three real regional profiles in `data/` with provenance.
- [ ] Eigenray search — launch angles that connect a source to a given receiver.
      Needed by echo synthesis.
- [ ] Range-dependent bathymetry (piecewise-linear bottom).

## v0.4 — Echo synthesis

- [ ] Doppler bank — replicate templates across Doppler bins so a fast target is
      matched rather than merely detected, and the range-Doppler bias (measured
      in v0.2, `docs/math_spec.md §6.2`) can actually be corrected.
- [ ] Cross-template ghost suppression: association logic across detections.
- [ ] Transmission loss along traced paths: spherical/cylindrical spreading plus
      Thorp absorption, so target strength numbers mean something.
- [ ] `EchoSynthesizer` — delay/Doppler/target-strength shaped echo generation,
      `Δt = 2Δd/c`; multi-target pulse trains.
- [ ] Ray-tube area and caustic handling, which is what a physically defensible
      shadow zone actually requires.
- [ ] Bearing estimation, which needs an array rather than the single channel
      v0.2 assumes.

**Honest scope note.** Anti-phase cancellation of a vehicle's acoustic cross
section is *not* achievable in practice with a point transducer against a
broadband ping across all bearings — hull scattering is distributed and
broadband. What can be simulated is narrowband, single-bearing nulling, and that
is what will be implemented, documented with its limits. Overclaiming here is
how a project loses the audience it is trying to reach.

## v0.5 — Covert acoustic communication

- [ ] DSSS modulator/demodulator with configurable chip rate and explicit
      processing gain `10·log10(N)`
- [ ] **Doppler-tolerant synchronisation.** In water this dominates: `v/c` with
      `c ≈ 1500 m/s` means 1 m/s of closing speed is 6.7e-4 — and it is a
      *time-scaling* of the waveform, not merely a frequency shift. HFM sweeps
      for the preamble, not LFM.
- [ ] Multipath-tolerant framing; CRC-32 plus RS(15,11) over GF(16) with static
      tables
- [ ] Bio-mimetic waveform shaping (spectral masking against ambient noise and
      biological transients)

## v0.6 — Bindings and portability

- [ ] Stable C ABI (`phantom.h`, hand-written, no generator)
- [ ] Rust `phantom-sonar-sys` + safe wrapper crate
- [ ] Cortex-M7 / RISC-V cross-compilation in CI with size and WCET reporting
- [ ] `-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti` build mode

## v0.7 — Hardware in the loop

See `docs/hardware.md` for the bench design and the bill of materials. Bench and
tank only — a real acoustic transmitter in open water is a regulatory and
marine-mammal issue, not a weekend experiment.

- [ ] Red Pitaya STEMlab acquisition path, measured end-to-end latency
- [ ] Tank measurements at 40–200 kHz, ping detection latency histogram
- [ ] Measured vs simulated arrival times, published as a figure

## Explicitly out of scope

- Anything requiring classified or export-controlled parameters. The library
  models physics that is in the open literature; it does not encode any
  platform's signature, any real system's waveform library, or any national
  capability.
- Deployable countermeasure firmware. This is a simulation and analysis library.
